# JavaScript Projects - Jefrey Zuniga

Welcome to my JavaScript projects repository! Here you'll find three initial projects I've developed as part of my journey in web development.

## 1. Snake Game

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where you control a snake and must eat food to make it grow. Avoid hitting walls and your own tail. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the game logic.

## 2. Stopwatch

The Stopwatch is a simple tool to measure time. You can start, stop, and reset the stopwatch as needed. This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface and stopwatch functionality.

## 3. Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a classical encryption technique where each letter in the original text is shifted a fixed number of positions to the right in the alphabet. This project allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher. The implementation is done in JavaScript.
